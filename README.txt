Miscellaneous utility Python scripts developed over the course of several independent consulting projects. This also includes some code samples I adapted from publicly available source. (The code is not proprietary in nature. For example, it was not "borrowed" from proprietary source files, nor based on proprietary processes.)

Spoiler alter: this is not "Pythonic python": I'm more into R&D than production programming. Nonetheless, there's a some useful scripts here, so I made the repository available. It is public in the spirit of open source software.
